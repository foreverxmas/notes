### Trait
- Traits are a fundamental unit of code reuse in Scala.
- A trait encapsulates method and field definitions, which can then be reused by mixing them into classes. Unlike class inheritance, in which each class must inherit from just one superclass, a class can mix in any number of traits.
- A trait also defines a type.
- Ordered trait: extends the Java `Comparable` interface which defines `compareTo` method.
- Stackable modification for a queue: Doubling, Incrementing, Filtering
